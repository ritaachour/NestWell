# Transparency System - Explaining Results to Users

## Overview

Our system maintains high quality standards (≥30/100) while being transparent about limitations. Users always get honest, helpful feedback.

## Quality Thresholds

### High Quality (≥30)
- **Shown to users**: ✅ Yes
- **How**: Full assessment with sources
- **Message**: "High-quality assessment based on X papers"

### Low Quality (<30)
- **Shown to users**: ⚠️ Yes, but with warnings
- **How**: Shows what's available with quality warnings
- **Message**: "Limited evidence - results should be interpreted with caution"

### No Papers (0)
- **Shown to users**: ❌ Clear explanation
- **How**: Explains why no assessment is possible
- **Message**: "No research available"

## User Experience by Scenario

### Scenario 1: High-Quality Papers Found ✅

**User sees:**
```
Risk Level: Moderate Risk
Confidence: High

Assessment: [Full detailed analysis]
Sources: [5 clickable papers]
Transparency Note: "✅ High-quality assessment based on 5 papers with average quality score of 72/100."
```

**User feels:** Confident in the assessment

---

### Scenario 2: Low-Quality Papers Found ⚠️

**User sees:**
```
Risk Level: Insufficient Data
Confidence: Low

Assessment: 
"⚠️ Limited Evidence Available

Assessment Based on Lower Quality Studies

[Basic assessment shown]

### Quality Breakdown:
- Papers found: 3
- Average quality score: 25/100 (below our 30/100 minimum)
- Clinical trials: 0

### Why This Matters:
Studies with quality scores below 30 may have:
- Small sample sizes
- Lack of proper controls
- Observational rather than experimental design
- Incomplete reporting
- Potential for bias

### Our Recommendation:
Due to the low quality of available evidence:
1. Do NOT rely solely on this assessment
2. Consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice
3. Consider alternative products with better evidence
4. Erring on the side of caution during pregnancy, breastfeeding, or when planning conception

### Transparency:
We're showing you what the research says, even though it doesn't meet our quality standards, so you have all available information to make an informed decision."

Transparency Note: "⚠️ Quality Warning: The available research has an average quality score of 25/100, which is below our minimum standard of 30/100. Results should be interpreted with caution."
```

**User feels:** Informed but cautious, knows limitations

---

### Scenario 3: No Papers Found ❌

**User sees:**
```
Risk Level: Insufficient Data
Confidence: None

Assessment:
"No Research Available

We couldn't find any published research papers about [ingredient] in [product type].

### What This Means:
- No peer-reviewed studies were found in PubMed database
- This ingredient may be: poorly studied, newly used, or search terms too specific
- Recommendation: Consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice

### How to Proceed:
1. Speak with your doctor or dermatologist
2. Check product manufacturer's safety data
3. Consider alternatives with more research available"

Transparency Note: "No research papers found to analyze."
```

**User feels:** Understands why assessment isn't possible, knows next steps

## Why This Approach Works

### Benefits:
✅ **Transparent** - Users understand data limitations  
✅ **Trustworthy** - Shows honesty about quality  
✅ **Actionable** - Always provides next steps  
✅ **Educational** - Users learn about research quality  
✅ **Honest** - Never hides limitations  

### User Trust:
- Shows we prioritize quality over convenience
- Demonstrates we care about accuracy
- Builds confidence in the platform
- Reduces liability concerns

---

## Technical Implementation

### The Flow:

1. **Try high-quality first** (min_quality_score: 30)
2. **If that fails**, try lower quality (min_quality_score: 0)
3. **If papers found but low quality**, show with warnings
4. **If no papers**, explain why

### Key Variables:

- `transparency_note`: Short explanation for user
- `quality_warning`: Boolean flag for UI styling
- `assessment`: Extended explanation with all details
- `sources`: Available papers (even if low quality)
