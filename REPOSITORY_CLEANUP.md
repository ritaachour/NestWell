## Document Redundancy Analysis

### Group 1: Railway Setup
- `RAILWAY_SETUP.md` - Basic setup
- `RAILWAY_QUICKSTART.md` - Quick guide
- `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md` - Troubleshooting

**Decision:** Keep all three - they serve different purposes:
- Setup: Initial configuration
- Quickstart: Fast reference
- Fix: Problem solving

### Group 2: Troubleshooting
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - General
- `TROUBLESHOOTING_404.md` - Specific issue
- `DEBUG_API_NOT_REACHED.md` - Specific issue

**Decision:** Keep all - different problem types

### Group 3: Fixes
- Multiple `FIX_*.md` files

**Decision:** Keep all - historical troubleshooting

### Group 4: Security
- `SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md` - Prevention
- `SECURITY_FIX.md` - Incident response
- `IMPORTANT_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture

**Decision:** Keep all - different purposes

---

## Recommendation: Keep All Documents

**Why:**
1. Each serves a specific purpose
2. Redundancy helps users find info quickly
3. Historical troubleshooting context valuable
4. No actual duplication of content
5. Different audiences use different docs

**Organization:**
- Current organization is logical
- No need to delete or merge
- All documents are useful

---

## Git Status

```bash
