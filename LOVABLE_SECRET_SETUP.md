# Setting Up Secrets in Lovable

## What You're Seeing

The "Add Secret" interface in Lovable lets you securely store sensitive information like API URLs and keys.

## How to Add Your API URL

### Step 1: Fill in the Secret Name

In the "Secret Name" field, enter:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
```

**Why this name?**
- In Next.js, environment variables that should be available in the browser must start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
- This makes it accessible in both client and server code

### Step 2: Enter Your API URL

Click the eye icon (üëÅÔ∏è) to toggle visibility, then enter your Railway API URL:

```
https://your-railway-app.railway.app
```

Replace `your-railway-app` with your actual Railway app name.

### Step 3: Click Submit

The secret is now securely stored and will be available to your app.
