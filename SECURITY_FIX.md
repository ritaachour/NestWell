# Security Alert - Actions Required

## What Happened

Your API key and email were exposed in the documentation files.

## Actions Required

### 1. REGENERATE YOUR GEMINI API KEY (CRITICAL)

Your Gemini API key was exposed: `AIzaSyDqi2ntfLK77TR1UuyyeHcAt6cLXGu0tUI`

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Delete the exposed API key
3. Create a new API key
4. Update your environment variables with the new key

### 2. UPDATE ALL DEPLOYMENTS

Update the key in:
- Railway environment variables
- Render.com environment variables (if deployed)
- Your local .env file
- Any other deployment platforms

### 3. WHAT WAS FIXED

- Removed API key from documentation
- Removed email address from documentation
- Replaced with generic placeholders
- Committed security fix to GitHub

### 4. VERIFY .env IS PROTECTED

```bash
# Verify .env is NOT tracked by Git
git ls-files | grep .env
# Should only show: .env.example

# Verify .gitignore is working
git check-ignore -v .env
# Should show: .gitignore:27:.env    .env
```

## Prevention

### Before Pushing to GitHub:

1. Check for secrets:
```bash
grep -r "AIza\|sk-.*" --exclude-dir=.git .
```

2. Review what you're committing:
```bash
git diff
git status
```

3. Never commit:
- API keys (Gemini, Anthropic, etc.)
- Passwords
- Email addresses (unless public)
- Database credentials
- .env file

### Safe to Commit:
- .env.example (template with fake values)
- Documentation with placeholders
- Code files
- README files

## Current Status

- Files updated with placeholders
- .env still properly ignored
- New commits won't expose credentials
- OLD commits still have the key (see below)

## Important Note

Your API key is still in Git history. Anyone who clones the repo can see it.

**Options:**
1. Regenerate the key (recommended) - prevents future use
2. Use git filter-branch to remove from history (advanced)
3. Make repository private if not already

## Next Steps

1. Regenerate Gemini API key now
2. Update all deployments with new key
3. Verify .env is never committed
4. Review all future commits before pushing
